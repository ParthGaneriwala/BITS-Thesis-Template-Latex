In this work, We proposed CondLaneNet, a novel top-
to-down lane detection framework that detects the lane in-
stances first and then instance-wisely predict the shapes.
Aiming to resolve the instance-level discrimination prob-
lem, we proposed the conditional lane detection strategy
based on conditional convolution and row-wise formula-
tion. Moreover, we designed RIM to cope with complex
lane line topologies such as dense lines and fork lines. Our
CondLaneNet framework refreshed the state-of-the-art per-
formance on CULane, CurveLanes, and TuSimple. More-
over, on CULane and CurveLanes, the small version of our
CondLaneNet not only surpassed other methods in accu-
racy, but also presented real-time efficiency.
