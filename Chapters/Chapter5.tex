To extensively evaluate the proposed method, we conducte
experiments on three benchmarks: CurveLanes [39], CU-
Lane [28], and TuSimple [36]. CurveLanes is a recently
proposed benchmark with cases of complex topologies such
as fork lines and dense lines. CULane is a widely used large
lane detection dataset with 9 different scenarios. TuSimple
is another widely used dataset of highway driving scenes.
The details of the three datasets are shown in Tab. 1.

\section{Initial Training}
If you are familiar with \LaTeX{}, then you can familiarise yourself with the contents of the Zip file and the directory structure and then place your own information into the `\texttt{Thesis.cls}' file. Section \ref{FillingFile} on page \pageref{FillingFile} tells you how to do this. Make sure you read section \ref{ThesisConventions} about thesis conventions to get the most out of this template and then get started with the `\texttt{Thesis.tex}' file straightaway.

If you are new to \LaTeX{} it is recommended that you carry on reading through the rest of the information in this document.

\LaTeX{} is not a WYSIWYG (What You See is What You Get) program, unlike word processors such as Microsoft Word or Apple's Pages. Instead, a document written for \LaTeX{} is actually a simple, plain text file that contains \emph{no formatting}. You tell \LaTeX{} how you want the formatting in the finished document by writing in simple commands amongst the text, for example, if I want to use \textit{italic text for emphasis}, I write the `$\backslash$\texttt{textit}\{\}' command and put the text I want in italics in between the curly braces. This means that \LaTeX{} is a ``mark-up'' language, very much like HTML.

\subsection{A (not so short) Introduction to \LaTeX{}}

If you are new to \LaTeX{}, there is a very good eBook -- freely available online as a PDF file -- called, ``The Not So Short Introduction to \LaTeX{}''. The book's title is typically shortened to just ``lshort''. You can download the latest version (as it is occasionally updated) from here:\\
\href{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf}{\texttt{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf}}

It is also available in several other languages. Find yours from the list on this page:\\
\href{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/}{\texttt{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/}}

It is recommended to take a little time out to learn how to use \LaTeX{} by creating several, small `test' documents. Making the effort now means you're not stuck learning the system when what you \emph{really} need to be doing is writing your thesis.

\subsection{A Short Math Guide for \LaTeX{}}

If you are writing a technical or mathematical thesis, then you may want to read the document by the AMS (American Mathematical Society) called, ``A Short Math Guide for \LaTeX{}''. It can be found online here:\\
\href{http://www.ams.org/tex/amslatex.html}{\texttt{http://www.ams.org/tex/amslatex.html}}\\
under the ``Additional Documentation'' section towards the bottom of the page.

\subsection{Common \LaTeX{} Math Symbols}
There are a multitude of mathematical symbols available for \LaTeX{} and it would take a great effort to learn the commands for them all. The most common ones you are likely to use are shown on this page:\\
\href{http://www.sunilpatel.co.uk/latexsymbols.html}{\texttt{http://www.sunilpatel.co.uk/latexsymbols.html}}

You can use this page as a reference or crib sheet, the symbols are rendered as large, high quality images so you can quickly find the \LaTeX{} command for the symbol you need.

\subsection{\LaTeX{} on a Mac}
 
The \LaTeX{} package is available for many systems including Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. The package for OS X is called MacTeX and it contains all the applications you need -- bundled together and pre-customised -- for a fully working \LaTeX{} environment and workflow.
 
MacTeX includes a dedicated \LaTeX{} IDE (Integrated Development Environment) called ``TeXShop'' for writing your `\texttt{.tex}' files and ``BibDesk'': a program to manage your references and create your bibliography section just as easily as managing songs and creating playlists in iTunes.
